# Ocean Solaris

A simulation of a gelatinous, shape-shifting ocean inspired by Stanislaw Lemâ€™s Solaris, created using Three.js.

This project aims to bring to life the mysterious, ever-changing alien entity from the classic sci-fi novel, featuring dynamic morphing, ethereal movements, and hypnotic visual patterns.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The simulation uses a custom WebGL shader system for realistic ocean rendering:

- **Vertex Shader**: Handles wave displacement and morphing animations. 
- **Fragment Shader**: Creates the gelatinous, semi-translucent appearance.
- **Perlin Noise**: Generates organic movement patterns.
- **Simplex Noise**: Creates spontaneous formation structures.
