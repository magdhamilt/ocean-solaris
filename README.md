# Ocean Solaris

A simulation of a gelatinous, shape-shifting ocean inspired by Stanislaw Lemâ€™s Solaris, created using Three.js.

This project aims to bring to life the mysterious, ever-changing alien entity from the classic sci-fi novel, featuring dynamic morphing, ethereal movements, and hypnotic visual patterns. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Ocean Simulation**: Continuously morphing gelatinous surface with realistic undulation.
- **Shape-shifting Simulacra**: Spontaneous generation of abstract structures and patterns.
- **Interactive Camera Controls**: Exploration of the ocean from multiple perspectives.
- **Atmospheric Rendering**: Ethereal lighting and fog effects to capture Solaris's alien atmosphere.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Optimized Performance**: Smooth 60fps animation with efficient WebGL rendering.
